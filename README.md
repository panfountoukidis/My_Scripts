The functions.py script, contains functions for several uses. More details are included in the script itself.
The ltool_validation_functions.py script, contains sevral functions which can be used for the validation of the EARLINET's LTOOL algorithm. The LTOOL algorithm can identify aerosol layers in the atmosphere. As a result gives the base, the top and the center of mass of
the identified layers.
The ltool_validation_profiles.py script, makes plots of the profiles of the backscatter (bsc) or extinction (ext) coefficients of a Lidar system. In those plots, the results of the LTOOL algorithm are plotted, as well.
More info are included in the scripts.
